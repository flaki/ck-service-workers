<h3>Versioning information</h3>

<p>Current as of July 2015, last significant update was 2015-07-13. <br>
  This content kit tracks the latest version of the <a href="https://github.com/slightlyoff/ServiceWorker/">service worker specification</a>
  and related specs, all code &amp; demos include the required browser version/implementation.</p>

<p>This content kit is published under the Mozilla Public License, version 2.0.</p>


<h2>About this content kit</h2>

<p>Not all audiences are created equal - so not all presentations and workshops should be the same as well.</p>

<p>This content kit aims to be as modular as possible - consisting of several types of teaching resources to help presenters give talks, show slides and/or host workshops. When speakers know their audience beforehand, they could easily mix-and-match the different resources to create the most appropriate presentation for their audience, and also adapt to any time constraints or environmental limitations they might be subject to.</p>


<h2>What should the presenter have?</h2>

<ul>
    <li>What hardware and software will the presenter need?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Slide decks are in HTML5 format, should be presentable on a recent browser in all 3 mayor operating systems</li>
        <li>Speaker will need an entry-level PC (tablet should work fine also!) hooked up to a display/projector</li>
        <li>Workshop: participants should have a personal computer, preferably running Linux or OSX</li>
        <li><strong>Network</strong><ul>
          <li>Most of the slides should work without internet connection.</li>
          <li>Embedded online content might be omitted (e.g. except external videos, tweets, etc.)</li>
          <li>Some small parts of the workshop might require internet connection</li>
        </ul></li>
      </ul>
    <li>What knowledge and background will the presenter most likely need?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Basic knowledge of the web, web development should be sufficient</li>
        <li>For dive-in parts and worshops, basic JavaScript &amp; Web Development skills</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
</ul>


<h2>What should the audience have?</h2>

<ul>
    <li>What hardware and software will the audience need?<ul>
      <li>Workshoppers will need:</li>
      <li>A PC to code on, preferably *nix based, like Mac OSX or Unix.</li>
      <li>Git, Node.js should be installed</li>
    </li>
    <li>What knowledge and background is the audience recommended have?<ul>
      <li>Basic web &amp; technology skills for attendees at nontechical talks</li>
      <li>JavaScript (intermediate) and web developer skills (basic) for technical talks, workshops</li>
      <li>Clear understanding of closures, callbacks, promises to work with service worker code</li>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Learning objectives</h2>

<p>After you present or teach this content kit, your audience will know how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A short 5 to 15 minute talk or intro composed of the content kit's intro modules is great for:
    <ul>
      <li>Introducing service workers for non-technical audiences, share the vision/possibilities they enable in the future</li>
      <li>Demonstrate basic usage and show possibilities for technical audiences</li>
      <li>Teach service worker basics &amp; intro to usage to audiences familiar with JavaScript-programming</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Deep-dive modules could be then used to elaborate on a subject matter like (for audiences familiar with code)
    <ul>
      <li>Showcase possible service worker use cases</li>
      <li>Urge users to experiment with service workers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
